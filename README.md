# BootstrapLandingPage
This is a fully responsive landing page design/template that I made for a dummy company named MDB using Bootstrap v5.1.0. I wanted to showcase different design elements possible with bootstrap while making a great looking site. It is amazing what you can achieve with Bootstrap and some custom css elements. I also incorporated free tools from the web to help me get this design such as <a href="https://cssgradient.io">cssgradient.io</a>, <a href="https://getwaves.io">getwaves.io</a> and <a href="https://manypixels.co/gallery">manypixels.co</a>.
